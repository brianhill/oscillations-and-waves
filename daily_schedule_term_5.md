### Week 8 &mdash; Torsion Pendulum &mdash; Coupled Torsion Pendula &mdash; Torsion Waves

#### As a way of refreshing on material that is now more than three weeks old due to the Term 4-5 break, our eleventh and twelfth notebooks (Torsion Pendulum and Coupled Torsion Pendula) are straightforward recapitulations of our fourth and eighth notebooks (Mass on a Spring and Coupled Harmonic Oscillators).

* Tuesday, March 18 &mdash; Problem Set 11: Do the Exercises from *EIWL3* Sections 29 and 30 &mdash; In-Class: Develop *[Torsion Pendula - Theory](./theory/TorsionPendula-Theory.nb.pdf)* and then complete the *[Torsion Pendulum](./worksheets/11-TorsionPendulum.nb.pdf)* and *[Coupled Torsion Pendula](./worksheets/12-CoupledTorsionPendula.nb.pdf)* notebooks

#### Similarly, our thirteenth notebook (Torsion Waves) is a straightforward recapitulation of our ninth notebook (Many Harmonic Oscillators), but we will press on the initial conditions harder and learn how to get waves that are not jumbled to appear.

* Friday, March 21 &mdash; Problem Set 12: Do the Exercises from *EIWL3* Sections 31 and 32 &mdash; In-Class: Complete the *[Torsion Waves](./worksheets/13-TorsionWaves.nb.pdf)* notebook

### Week 9 &mdash; Two-Dimensional Grids of Masses

#### Plans for upcoming classes are subject to adjustment, depending especially on the actual pace of the previous classes.

* Tuesday, March 25 &mdash; Square Grid of Masses
* Friday, March 28 &mdash; Radial Grid of Masses

### Week 10 &mdash; Three-Dimensional Grid of Masses &mdash; Exam 2

* Tuesday, April 1 &mdash; Cubical Grid of Masses
* Friday, April 4 &mdash; Exam 2

### Week 11 &mdash; Continuous Systems from The *n&rarr;&infin;* Limit

#### We are going to blast into the stratosphere and instead of doing large numbers of particles &mdash; like 72 rods or 100 masses &mdash; for the remainder of the course, we are going to take the limit that *n&rarr;&infin;.* You might reasonably ask how does Mathematica cope with continuous systems which have an infinite number of particles? Deep under the hood, it breaks continuous systems up into little chunks, but from now on in this course, you are not going to have to code those little chunks up as we have been doing. Functions that are built into Mathematica will be doing that work. In fact, the little time steps that we have been manually coding are also well within the repertoire of Mathematica to do without us every having to even know what time steps are being used to approximate the infinity of possible times that exists in any time interval in the real world.
