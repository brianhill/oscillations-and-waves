### Week 8 &mdash; Torsion Pendulum &mdash; Coupled Torsion Pendula &mdash; Torsion Waves

#### As a way of refreshing on material that is now more than three weeks old due to the Term 4-5 break, our eleventh and twelfth notebooks (Torsion Pendulum and Coupled Torsion Pendula) are straightforward recapitulations of our fourth and eighth notebooks (Mass on a Spring and Coupled Harmonic Oscillators).

* Tuesday, March 18 &mdash; Problem Set 11: Do the Exercises from *EIWL3* Sections 29 and 30 &mdash; In-Class: Develop *[Torsion Pendula - Theory](./theory/TorsionPendula-Theory.nb.pdf)* and then complete the *[Torsion Pendulum](./worksheets/11-TorsionPendulum.nb.pdf)* and *[Coupled Torsion Pendula](./worksheets/12-CoupledTorsionPendula.nb.pdf)* notebooks

#### Similarly, our thirteenth notebook (Torsion Waves) is a straightforward recapitulation of our ninth notebook (Many Harmonic Oscillators), but we will press on the initial conditions harder and learn how to get waves that are not jumbled to appear.

* Friday, March 21 &mdash; Problem Set 12: Do the Exercises from *EIWL3* Sections 31 and 32 &mdash; In-Class: Complete the *[Torsion Waves](./worksheets/13-TorsionWaves.nb.pdf)* notebook

### Week 11 &mdash; Continuous Systems from the *n&rarr;&infin;* Limit &mdash; Guitar Strings and Drumheads

#### We have a little less than one-third of the course left, and we are going to blast into the stratosphere: instead of doing large numbers of particles &mdash; like 72 rods or 100 masses &mdash; we are going to take the limit that *n&rarr;&infin;.* You might reasonably ask that if it is too expensive for Mathematica to do a million particles for a million time steps, how is Mathematica going to cope with continuous systems which have an infinite number of particles? The answer is that deep under the hood, it breaks continuous systems up into little chunks just as we have been chunking up the world by simulating large numbers of small masses. In other words, Mathematica turns the continuous problems back into problems with a finite number of particles. However, from now on in this course, Mathematica is going to hide its need for those little chunks from you. Also, in a real system, there is an infinity of possible times that exist in any time interval, but we have been breaking the time interval up into a finite number of time steps. It is also well within Mathematica's repertoire to hide from us its need to break continuous time up into time steps. Mathematica draws graphs and creates animations by choosing the chunks and the time steps to be so small that we cannot perceive them unless we blow up the graphics to a large size. Sometimes, the chunkiness leaks through enough to be obvious in the graphics, but if that happens and we are not satisfied, we can order Mathematica to use finer grids and finer time steps. Of course, the processor in your laptop may not appreciate this, but if you are patient with your computer's processor, and also if your computer has enough memory to hold the intermediate results, there is no limit to how accurately Mathematica can do most simulations â€” the only exceptions being simulations with singularities, and these are only encountered in extreme situations.
