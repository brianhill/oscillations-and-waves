## Daily Schedule Term 4

### Week 1 &mdash; Lightning Introduction to Mathematica Notebooks &mdash; Displaying Motion

* Monday, Jan. 13 &mdash; Preparation for class: Study Sections 1-3 of [*An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language, 3rd Edition*](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/index.html.en), hereafter abbreviated *EIWL3* &mdash; In class, we will work through a little demonstration called *[Heads or Tails](./demonstrations/HeadsOrTails.nb.pdf)* that builds on Sections 1-3

#### Problem sets will generally be turned in by email using Mathematica notebooks. The last step in your process before you submit a notebook as your solution is to quit the Mathematica kernel, and then re-execute your entire notebook with a fresh kernel. Assuming your notebook executes reproducibly and without error with a fresh kernel, you have something you can turn in. If it doesn't execute reproducibly and without error, find and fix the problems, and repeat this process until it does.

* Thursday, Jan. 16 &mdash; Assignment for Thursday, Jan. 16: Before Thursday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves *all* of the exercises from Sections 1-4 of *EIWL3* &mdash; Preparation for class: Look ahead to Sections 5 and 6 of *EIWL3* &mdash; In class, we will work through a small but critical bit of physics, *[Position from Velocity &mdash; Theory](./demonstrations/PositionFromVelocity-Theory.nb.pdf),* and then a little demonstration called *Position from Velocity &mdash; Using Associations,* and at the end of that, we will display the resulting motion as a graph

### Week 2 &mdash; Acceleration &mdash; Newton's Laws of Motion

* Monday, Jan. 20 &mdash; Assignment for Thursday, Jan. 16: Before Monday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves all the exercises from Sections 5-8 of *EIWL3* and also convert *Position from Velocity &mdash; Using Associations* to a new notebook *Position from Velocity &mdash; Using Lists,* and email me that notebook

&mdash; Preparation for class: Look ahead to Section 9 of *EIWL3*
