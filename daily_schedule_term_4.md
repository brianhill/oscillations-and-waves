## Daily Schedule Term 4

### Week 1 &mdash; Lightning Introduction to Mathematica Notebooks &mdash; Displaying Motion

* Tuesday, Jan. 14 &mdash; Preparation for class: Study Sections 1-3 of [*An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language, 3rd Edition*](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/index.html.en), hereafter abbreviated *EIWL3* &mdash; Expressions, operator precedence, symbolic manipulation, built-in functions, and user-defined functions in Mathematica &mdash; We will work through a little demonstration called *[Heads or Tails](./demonstrations/HeadsOrTails.nb.pdf)* which demonstrates user-defined functions and nested functions
* Friday, Jan. 17 &mdash; Assignment for Friday, Jan. 17: Before Friday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves *all* of the exercises from Sections 1-4 of *EIWL3* &mdash; Preparation for class: Look ahead to Sections 5 and 6 of *EIWL3* &mdash; In class, we will work through a small but critical bit of physics, *[Position from Velocity &mdash; Theory](./demonstrations/PositionFromVelocity-Theory.nb.pdf)* &mdash; Getting through that theory might be enough already, but we might have time to get to a little demonstration called *[Position from Velocity &mdash; Using Associations](./demonstrations/PositionFromVelocity-UsingAssociations.nb.pdf),* &mdash; If we are really speedy, we will get to the point of displaying the position as a graph, but that might have to wait for the next class

### Week 2 &mdash; Acceleration &mdash; Newton's Laws of Motion

#### Plans for upcoming classes are subect to adjustment, depending especially on the actual pace of the previous classes

* Tuesday, Jan. 21 &mdash; Assignment for Tuesday, Jan. 21: Before Tuesday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves all the exercises from Sections 5-8 of *EIWL3* and (assuming we got this far), also convert *Position from Velocity &mdash; Using Associations* to a new notebook *Position from Velocity &mdash; Using Lists,* and email me that notebook
* Friday, Jan. 24
