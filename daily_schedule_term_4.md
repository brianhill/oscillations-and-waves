## Daily Schedule Term 4

### Week 1 &mdash; Lightning Introduction to Mathematica Notebooks &mdash; Velocity

* Tuesday, Jan. 14 &mdash; Preparation for class: Study Sections 1-3 of [*An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language, 3rd Edition*](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/index.html.en), hereafter abbreviated *EIWL3* &mdash; Expressions, operator precedence, symbolic manipulation, built-in functions, and user-defined functions in Mathematica &mdash; We will work through a little demonstration called *[Heads or Tails](./demonstrations/HeadsOrTails.nb.pdf)* which demonstrates user-defined functions and nested functions
* Friday, Jan. 17 &mdash; Assignment for Friday, Jan. 17: Before Friday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves all of the exercises from Sections 1-4 of *EIWL3* &mdash; [PS01 Solution](./solutions/2025-01-17/Brian-PS01.nb.pdf) &mdash; We learned four more notebook features that greatly enhance readability: plain text cells, section cells, subsection cells, and comments in code &mdash; In class, we worked through a small but critical bit of physics, *[Position from Velocity &mdash; Theory](./demonstrations/PositionFromVelocity-Theory.nb.pdf)* &mdash; We manually filled out a [Position from Velocity Worksheet](./demonstrations/PositionFromVelocity-Worksheet.pdf) that demonstrates the theory we have developed so far the case of linearly increasing velocity (aka constant or uniform acceleration)

### Week 2 &mdash; Acceleration &mdash; Newton's 2nd Law

* Tuesday, Jan. 21 &mdash; Assignment for Tuesday, Jan. 21: Before Tuesday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves all of the exercises from Sections 5-8 of *EIWL3* &mdash; [PS02 Solution](./solutions/2025-01-21/Brian-PS02.nb.pdf) &mdash; Look ahead to Section 9 of *EIWL3* &mdash; In class: You will start building out *[Position from Velocity &mdash; Constant Acceleration](./demonstrations/PositionFromVelocity-ConstantAcceleration.nb.pdf)*

#### Plans for upcoming classes are subject to adjustment, depending especially on the actual pace of the previous classes

* Friday, Jan. 24 &mdash; Before Friday's class, create and email me a notebook that solves all the exercises from Sections 9-12 of *EIWL3* &mdash; If we did not complete it in class, I will have you also email me your finished version of the *Position from Velocity &mdash; Constant Acceleration* notebook
