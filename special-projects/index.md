#### Special projects being presented in Weeks 12 and 13

* Jeremy and Eli: The [Lotke-Volterra Equations](./LotkeVolterraEquations.nb.pdf)
* Rania: Bohr and Wheeler's [Liquid Drop Model of Fission](./LiquidDropModelOfFission.nb.pdf)
* Hexi and Walker: The [Black-Scholes](./Black-Scholes.nb.pdf) formula
* Harper and Tahm: [External Rifle Ballistics](,/ExternalRifleBallistics.nb.pdf)

Each special project presentation should include a Mathematica notebook that has a description of what you are solving, is interleaved with explanations of how the code you are presenting solves it, and ideally, has activities for the rest of us to do to help us become familiar with the problem and the solution technique. Email your notebook to the class before your presentation. Use notebook chapters, section, and subsections, and other typesetting features to make your presentation organized and professional-looking. It is fine to rely heavily on already-existing resources. The goal is a clear explanation of a problem and its solution, not to achieve something original.
